	<div id="TextBox1">Who am I?<br>
		<br>
		<span id="TextBoxParagraph2">I, CoreyStar7 (Corey), am an inspired digital creator that develops games under the ROBLOX platform, make sprite animations entirely within Adobe Animate and lastly other small things that are related to my YouTube Channel (link in Socials).
		</span>
	</div>

	<div id="TextBox2">What are my goals?<br>
		<br>
		<span id="TextBoxParagraph1">My goals with anything I create is to make an experience greater then the last, to improve at anything I create, then go back to it and do it ten times better then the last. Simply put, this website has been re-written four times, this has been the forth attempt. Which means this site has been streamlined and improved each time to be more and more user friendly.
		</span>
		
	<div id="TextBox10">How did I get my start online?<br>
		<br>
		<span id="TextBoxParagraph1">Well this can be easily sumarised since I didn't have much background to begin with. Rewind back to around 2014 when I was starting to actually develop a brain, whilst watching YouTube like any normal 21st child would do in my spare time I came across this series called "Super Mario Bros Z (SMBZ)" which inspired me later on to create Phantom Madness.
		<br>
		<span id="TextBoxParagraph1">As for my other indevours (ROBLOX Game Development) I was very intrested in creating my own gaming experiences in 2015 when I found out about Game Development's entire existance, ever since then I've grown a huge appretiation for Game Developers as it takes a really long time to prefect a product and release it not only on time, but with high reviews.
		<br>
		<span id="TextBoxParagraph1">Anyway moving on since I started playing games on the ROBLOX platform in 2016 I always wanted to create a really popular and praised game on the platform, one that people look back on with great opinions and that everyone can enjoy, though that has slightly changed I still want to create the best possible gaming experiences on ROBLOX to do with a theme.
		<br>
		<span id="TextBoxParagraph1">And it turns out that by doing such a thing it got me to where I'm at today, sitting at a clean 200 subscribers as I'm writing this (24/02/2021), which I cannot thank everyone enough. But other then that, that's a sumary on how I got to the stage I am now, hopefully you'll be seeing some more immprovements down the line such as this site :)
