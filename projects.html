		<div id="TextBox3">Sonic Xtreme Roblox<br>
		<br>
		<span id="TextBoxParagraph1">Sonic Xtreme Roblox is a project I worked on for about a year and is still in production but has been slightly halted so I can work on T.B.R and my animations.<br>
		<br>If you'd like to see the Resouces used to make S.X.R possible go to "Open Source Resources" to download a Zip folder containing all the resources used in S.X.R!</span>
		</div>
		
		<div id="TextBox4">The Backrooms Revisited<br>
		<br>
		<span id="TextBoxParagraph3">The Backrooms Revisited is one of many Backrooms fangames on the Internet built on the Roblox Engine coded in Lua. This project has been in the works since around August of 2020 and has been one of my highest priorities, it clearly shows doesn't it?<br>
		<br>Just like S.X.R if you visit the "Open Source Resources Page" you can nab a Zip folder contaning all the game's contents, scripting, objects and more!</span>
		</div>
		
		<div id="TextBox5">Phantom Madness<br>
		<br>
		<span id="TextBoxParagraph4">This is a project I haven't personally talked about much as it hasn't been worked on yet due to time constraints, however in a month or two you'll see more updates on my YouTube channel about it. Currently it's a planned Sprite Animation Series that's mostly described in this short sentence; "It's SMBZ but instead of Mario Characters it's Freedom Planet Characters."<br>
		<br>In short, yeah it's a STX x FP Series, at first I was planning on shelfing the idea due to someone already doing it right before I was about to announce it as a teaser in one of my YT videos however the creator of that series encouraged me to continue working on it, so that's what I'm doing, expect more information soon about it in the near future :)</span>
