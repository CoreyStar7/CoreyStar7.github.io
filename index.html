		<br>
		<span id="TextBoxParagraph2">This here website was built for a school project starting from early November to the start of December in 2020, however I've since adopted it and cleaned it to make a website that is truly my own! There's still more to come so be sure to check it out once the site updates. Remember, this site was made for a school project, so I had a strict time to make it.</span>

		<div id="TextBox2">What are my goals?<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<span id="TextBoxParagraph1">My goals with anything I create is to make an experience greater then the last, to improve at anything I create, then go back to it and do it ten times better then the last. Simply put, this website has been re-written three times, this has been the third attempt. Which means this site has been streamlined and improved each time to be more and more user friendly.</span>
