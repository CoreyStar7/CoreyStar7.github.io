		<div id="Catagory1">The Backrooms Revisited</div>
		
		<div id="TextBox6">Working on Xbox / Console Controller Support<br>
		<br>
		<span id="TextBoxParagraph3">Soon The Backrooms Revisited will have full controller support, sprinting, using items and movement will all be overhauled inside T.B.R for Console to make a better experience! Console players on Roblox seem to always get the short end of the stick, but today thatâ€™s changing for the better. I want to unify the experience with controller and to make it the stock thought with any Roblox project / game.</span>
		</div>
		
		<div id="TextBox7">Cutscenes<br>
		<br>
		<span id="TextBoxParagraph3">Soon T.B.R will feature fully animated cutscenes that link the story together instead of making everyone read constantly, this will make sure that the presentation of the game will fit well with everything else around it, plus animated cutscenes is something that not many Roblox games do, so to be completely original I'm deciding to add it as a feature. Don't like it? Then you can skip it at any time with a press of a button!</span>

		<div id="TextBox8">S.X.R Overhaul<br>
		<br>
		<span id="TextBoxParagraph5">Sonic Xtreme Roblox is soon to get an overhaul, graphics, gameplay, everything will be one step closer to the original game! There'll even be a 4:3 mode if you fancy that. So far there's proprer Ring and Live collection, soon to be Live and Ring tallies that keep track of how many Rings and Lives you have at a given time, fixed textures, proper animated texture work and so much more to come! Stay tuned on my YouTube Channel to hear more about the overhaul, cause it's going to be a huge leap in S.X.R's development!</span>

		<div id="TextBox9">Phantom Madness<br>
		<br>
		<span id="TextBoxParagraph5">Regarding Phantom Madness' I can give you the link to my Story Script if you'd like to read and comment on the Google Document, the link is below and I'd like to hear some feedback on it. Because I've had this mapped into my head for quite some time now, about 2 - 6 months to be more precise. So if you want to give it a read yourself, check the link below to view the document for yourself, remember, don't be afraid to criticize the project, if you feel like something should be changed, try mentioning it in the comments, thank you :)<br></span>
